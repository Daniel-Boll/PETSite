  "content": "The volume of activities undertaken by PETComp is massive, such as the organization of talks and events, the development of outreach projects, etc. To develop such activities in the best way possible, we hold weekly meetings. These meetings are written in shared minutes, in order to keep a history of the decisions taken and help in future plannings. Since part of these activities is focused on the external community or other Computer Science students, they need to be promoted, therefore PETComp social medias are used to advertise events, meetings and projects. This is a project that embraces all other activities done by the group.",
